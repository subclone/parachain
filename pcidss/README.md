# PCIDSS Compliant Oracle Gateway

Workspace contains three crates:

- `pcidss-oracle` - the oracle itself
- `op-api` - Oracle Provider API
- `op-core` - Common primitive core types and traits used by both oracle and API

Workspace is written in a decoupled way, so that it is possible to add more services in the future.

Please refer to crate level READMEs for more information.
