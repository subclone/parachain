# ISO-8553 Infrastracture

This repository contains the infrastructure for ISO-8553 implementation for Substrate based chains. It contains of parts that are responsible for processing ISO-8553 messages, maintaining offchain ledger. With these components, it will be possible to mock full cycle of ISO-8583 messages.

This is the high-level overview of the infrastracture:

![iso-8583-overview](https://github.com/subclone/payment-processor/assets/88332432/01c97bed-2ec8-4041-9702-cf079477e9be)

## Run the demo

For demonstration purposes, `docker-compose` configuration is provided. It will start the following services:

- [Demo merchant application](./interface/README.md)
- [Payment Processor Server](./payment-processor/README.md)
- PCIDSS compliant [oracle](./pcidss/README.md)
- Postgres database

To start the demo, first pull the images:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

Then start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You will be able to access the demo merchant application at `http://0.0.0.0:3001`.

## Demo flow

Documentation of [merchant application](./interface/README.md) contains the details about the demo flow, you can follow it to fully test the setup. Note that, sometimes websocket connection with frontend is lost, so you might need to refresh the page.

## Notes

Some important notes about the project:

- It is a PoC implementation, so there are many places where we cut corners and some things are hard coded.
- ISO-8583:1987 standard is used.
- Substrate chain integration is not implemented yet.
- Unit tests are more like integration tests (somewhat similar to Substrate).

## Contents

Contains three key parts for ISO-8553 message processing:

1. [Demo merchant application](./interface/README.md)
2. [Server application](./payment-processor/README.md) for processing requests from merchant application
3. PCIDSS compliant [oracle](./pcidss/README.md)

### Demo Merchant Application

React application with mock bank interface and a demo checkout page.

### Payment Processor Server

NodeJs server that is responsible for processing requests from merchant application and sending them to the gateway simulator.

### PCIDSS Compliant Oracle Gateway

JSON-RPC based message consumer that maintains offchain ledger and a processor for ISO-8553 messages. In the future will have Substrate chain watcher service integrated.
